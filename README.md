# Spam Email Classifier using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

![Project Image](url_to_project_image)

This project aims to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The classifier identifies patterns in email content and metadata to predict whether an email is likely to be spam or not.

## Overview

The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the implementation of a KNN-based spam email classifier. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a collection of labeled emails, comprising both spam and non-spam emails. The dataset can be downloaded using [this link](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/Enron-Spam/index.html)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/spam-email-classifier.git
    ```


## Usage

1. Open the `spam classifier using knn.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook to execute the code cells.
3. Ensure that you have your dataset available and modify the notebook to load your data accordingly.

## Results

The K-Nearest Neighbors classifier achieved an accuracy of 72.15% on the test set, demonstrating its capability to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations can be found in the notebook.
